A Rust library that allows you to perform Kagi searches programmatically using chromiumoxide, without consuming additional API credits.

## ✨ Features

- 💳 No additional API credits required
- 🔐 Supports token-based, F2A-based and cookie-based authentication
- 🕵️ Incognito mode allows you to perform searches without saving your authentication.

## 📦 Installation

Add `kagisearch` to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
kagisearch = "0.3"
```

async-std users should use the `async-std-runtime` feature:

```toml
[dependencies]
kagisearch = { version = "0.3", features = ["async-std-runtime"], default-features = false }
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

```rust
use kagisearch::{AuthType, Kagi};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
    // Initialize the browser with your Kagi token
    let kagi = Kagi::new(AuthType::Token("your_token_here".to_string())).await?;
    // Perform a search and get up to 5 results
    let results = kagi.search("Rust programming language", 5, None).await?;

    let Some(results) = results else {
        return Err(anyhow::anyhow!("No search results found"));
    };

    // Print the results
    for result in results {
        println!("{:?}", result);
    }

    kagi.close().await?;

    Ok(())
}
```
